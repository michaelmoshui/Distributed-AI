# Raspberry Pi ML

The purpose of this project is to explore distributed neural network training on multiple Raspberry Pis. Training performance is not meant to surpass GPUs in any sense; the main intention is to explore computing clusters and learning about the inner working of deep learning with self-implemented neural network layers.

## Completion (as of May 2nd, 2024):
* Basic deep learning framework (Dense, ReLU, Sigmoid, Binary Crossentropy)
* Sample implementation
* BatchNorm

## To be completed (very general to be expanded):
* Raspberry Pi Setup
* Distriuted learning Pipeline
* More advanced deep learning components (optimizers, normalization layers, etc...)
